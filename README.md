## Volumetric Locking and its Alleviation in Finite Element Analysis

This project work involves the implementation of finite element methods to alleviate the problem of volumetric locking in structural elements. This included the investigation why and where volumetric locking occurs and what are the methods to reduce it. Because Locking can occur for multiple reasons. In this analysis locking due to the governing equations which are trying to solve are poorly conditioned, which leads to an ill-conditioned system of finite element equations is examined. This analysis is carried on a 2-Dimensional plate element (Plane Stress Condition). Formulation of finite element equations for a 2-Dimensional plate is carried out and using computational tool (MALAB), displacement which is main parameter which get effected due to volumetric locking is examined. Results obtained through computations are compared and analyzed through comparing with analytical solutions. Analytical solutions are obtained using ANSYS software.
